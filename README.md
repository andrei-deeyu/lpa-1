## Overview

The goal of these apps is to enable us to run a LPA event(s).
We got three web apps (so far):

* [Admin Web App](https://lpa-1.firebaseapp.com/) - Used by the organizers to set the schedule for the mentors and startups. 
  * The mentors and attendees emails/names should be added to the system so they will be 'white listed'.
  * The startups' details should be filled.
  * The schedule per day of the LPA.

* [Mentor Web App](https://lpa-1.firebaseapp.com/index-mentor.html) - Used by the mentors to see who they are going to meet (=which startup) and when.
  * The mentor should sign-in with their gmail account and fill their personal details.
  * Next, she can see what is the schedule per day.

* [Attendee Web App](https://lpa-1.firebaseapp.com/startup.html) - Used by the startups/attendees to see who is the lovely mentor that will work with them.
  * The attendee should sign-in with their gmail account and fill their personal details.
  * Next, she can see what is the schedule per day.
