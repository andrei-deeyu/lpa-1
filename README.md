## Overview

The goal of these apps is to enable us to run a LPA event(s).
We got three web apps:

* [Admin Web App](https://lpa-1.firebaseapp.com/) - Used by the organizers to set the schedule for the mentors and startups.
  * The mentors and attendees emails/names should be added to the system so they will be 'white listed'.
  * The startups' details should be filled.
  * The schedule per day of the LPA.

* [Mentor Web App](https://lpa-1.firebaseapp.com/index-mentor.html) - Used by the mentors to see who they are going to meet (=which startup) and when.
  * The mentor should sign-in with their gmail account and fill their personal details.
  * Next, she can see what is the schedule per day.
  * After each session, the mentor should fill the notes' section. This will help us learn and improve.
  * Check this [intro video](https://youtu.be/trJcLl413hg) to the mentor app.
  * You can use: https://bit.ly/lpa-m


* [Attendee Web App](https://lpa-1.firebaseapp.com/startup.html) - Used by the startups/attendees to see who is the lovely mentor that will work with them.
  * The attendee should sign-in with their gmail account and fill their personal details.
  * Next, she can see what is the schedule per day.
  * After each session, the attendee should fill the notes' section. This will help us get better.
  * Check this [intro video](https://youtu.be/psdF_o25dJc) to the attendee app.
